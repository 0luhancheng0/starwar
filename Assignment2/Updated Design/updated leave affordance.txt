This is the documentation of several changes we made in leave class

1.  The getActorLocation() method in original design is deleted

    Instead of create a seperate method to get the actor's location i decided
    to put the equivalent code inside the act() method, which invoke the
    whereis() method to determine where the entity target should be
    placed

2.  The implementation of SWActionInterface in the diagram should not appear in
    diagram

    Leave affordance has extended the SWAffordance class, which has implemented
    SWActionInterface

3.  Associativity with EntityManager added
    In the act() method, entityManager was kept as


4.  Dependency with SWEntityInterface, MessageRenderer, EntityManager
    and SWWorld added

    Instance of MessageRenderer and SWEntityInterface are passed into
    constructor as parameter, so there should be dependency exist
    When leave class get the location of a actor, the static attribute
    entityManager is returned by the function getEntityManger() inside SWWorld,
    and the method whereis() in EntityManager is invoked. They all implies
    dependency
